# Kessel Inventory Consumer

The Kessel Inventory Consumer (KIC) is a standalone dedicated Kafka consumer group used to expose an eventing based entry point to the Kessel Inventory API. Its purpose is to subscribe to Service Provider owned Kafka topics and ensure reporter resource updates are replicated to Inventory API through events.

### To Build:
`make local-build`

### To Build Container Image:

_Linux/Windows_
```shell
export IMAGE=your-quay-repo
make docker-build-push
```

_MacOS_

```shell
export QUAY_REPO_INVENTORY=your-quay-repo # required
podman login quay.io # required, this target assumes you are already logged in
make build-push-minimal
```

### To Run:

Prerequisites: You need to have the basic kafka setup deployed in order to test. You can use any of the docker compose options ([standard](https://github.com/project-kessel/inventory-api/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#running-locally-using-docker-compose) or [more elaborate](https://github.com/project-kessel/inventory-api/blob/main/docs/dev-guides/docker-compose-options.md)) in Inventory API to setup the backend services, including Kafka

#### Using local binary

```shell
make build
./bin/inventory-consumer start --consumer.bootstrap-servers localhost:9092
```

**Using Podman (requires you build the image first)**
```shell
podman run --network kessel -d quay.io/YOUR-IMAGE-HERE:TAG start --consumer.bootstrap-servers kafka:9093
```

#### Using Podman Compose (Recommended)

>[!NOTE]
>The podman compose setup is meant to replicate an ephemeral-like environment locally and requires Inventory API and Relations API to be running by default. You will need both repos cloned down in order to set everything up.

1. In the root of your cloned Inventory API repo: `make inventory-up-relations-ready`

2. In the root of your cloned Relations API reo:
    * Pull down an official schema that will support the consumer:

    ```shell
    curl -o deploy/schema.zed https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatInsights/rbac-config/refs/heads/master/configs/stage/schemas/schema.zed
    ```
    * Start Relations API: `make relations-api-up`

Then:

```shell
# Deploy KIC and related dependencies
# This will include a test HBI database for now, Kafka Connect cluster and topic creation
make inventory-consumer-up
```

This will allow you to test Kessel Inventory Consumer by producing messages to any created topics that the consumer is configured to monitor (see [config file](./development/configs/full-setup.yaml)).

See the [Development Docs](./development/docs) for info on specific service provider testing use cases.

#### Using Ephemeral

```shell
# Deploy Kessel Services (this will also deploy relations and inventory api)
bonfire deploy kessel -C kessel-inventory-consumer
```

#### Testing in Ephemeral

>[!NOTE]
>Since the Kessel Inventory Consumer is only used for HBI currently, for any testing, its recommended to use the process in the insights-deployer-script for standing everything up and testing. Any below testing is just basic validation of the service working and is not indicative of a final setup. See the [HBI Migration Runbook](https://github.com/project-kessel/insights-service-deployer/blob/main/docs/hbi-migration-runbook.md) for more details

To perform a basic test in Ephemeral you need to produce a message to the topic for the consumer to create the resource

```shell
BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=$(oc get secret kessel-inventory -o json | jq -r '.data."cdappconfig.json"' | base64 -d | jq -r '.kafka.brokers[] | "\(.hostname):\(.port)"')
oc run kcat --rm -i --tty --image quay.io/anatale/kcat:fedora --env BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS="$BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS" -- bash

# Create an HBI Host using Outbox
echo '{"schema":{"type":"string","optional":false},"payload":"dd1b73b9-3e33-4264-968c-e3ce55b9afec"}|{"schema":{"type":"struct","fields":[{"type":"string","optional":true,"field":"type"},{"type":"string","optional":true,"field":"reporter_type"},{"type":"string","optional":true,"field":"reporter_instance_id"},{"type":"struct","fields":[{"type":"struct","fields":[{"type":"string","optional":true,"field":"local_resource_id"},{"type":"string","optional":true,"field":"api_href"},{"type":"string","optional":true,"field":"console_href"},{"type":"string","optional":true,"field":"reporter_version"}],"optional":true,"name":"metadata"},{"type":"struct","fields":[{"type":"string","optional":true,"field":"workspace_id"}],"optional":true,"name":"common"},{"type":"struct","fields":[{"type":"string","optional":true,"field":"satellite_id"},{"type":"string","optional":true,"field":"subscription_manager_id"},{"type":"string","optional":true,"field":"insights_id"},{"type":"string","optional":true,"field":"ansible_host"}],"optional":true,"name":"reporter"}],"optional":true,"name":"representations"}],"optional":true,"name":"payload"},"payload":{"type":"host","reporter_type":"hbi","reporter_instance_id":"3088be62-1c60-4884-b133-9200542d0b3f","representations":{"metadata":{"local_resource_id":"dd1b73b9-3e33-4264-968c-e3ce55b9afec","api_href":"https://apiHref.com/","console_href":"https://www.console.com/","reporter_version":"2.7.16"},"common":{"workspace_id":"a64d17d0-aec3-410a-acd0-e0b85b22c076"},"reporter":{"satellite_id":"2c4196f1-0371-4f4c-8913-e113cfaa6e67","subscription_manager_id":"af94f92b-0b65-4cac-b449-6b77e665a08f","insights_id":"05707922-7b0a-4fe6-982d-6adbc7695b8f","ansible_host":"host-1"}}}}' | kcat -P -b $BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS -H "operation=ReportResource" -H "version=v1beta2" -t outbox.event.hbi.hosts -K "|"

# Delete the same HBI Host using Outbox
echo '{"schema":{"type":"string","optional":false},"payload":"dd1b73b9-3e33-4264-968c-e3ce55b9afec"}|{"schema":{"type":"struct","fields":[{"type":"struct","fields":[{"type":"string","optional":true,"field":"resource_type"},{"type":"string","optional":true,"field":"resource_id"},{"type":"struct","fields":[{"type":"string","optional":true,"field":"type"}],"optional":true,"name":"reporter"}],"optional":true,"name":"reference"}],"optional":true,"name":"payload"},"payload":{"reference":{"resource_type":"host","resource_id":"dd1b73b9-3e33-4264-968c-e3ce55b9afec","reporter":{"type":"hbi"}}}}' | kcat -P -b $BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS -H "operation=DeleteResource" -H "version=v1beta2" -t outbox.event.hbi.hosts -K "|"
```

### Monitoring

Prometheus metrics can be captured from both the Kessel Inventory Consumer, and if deployed, the Kessel Kafka Connect pod

KIC metrics are available on port 9000:

```shell
# Run local binary/container or `oc port-forward svc/kessel-inventory-consumer-service 9000:9000`
curl localhost:9000/metrics
```

Kafka Connect metrics are available on port 9404:
```shell
oc port-forward kessel-kafka-connect-connect-0 9404:9404
curl localhost:9404/metrics
```

### Monitoring in Ephemeral using Podman Compose

The monitoring stack available in [Kessel Inventory](https://github.com/project-kessel/inventory-api/blob/main/docs/dev-guides/docker-compose-options.md#monitoring-stack-only) can be used to monitor replication-related workloads in Ephemeral for performance testing.

The process consists of:
1. Starting the monitoring stack using podman (see above link)
2. Port forward each of the services locally

```shell
# Note: the address 0.0.0.0 is used to ensure the podman containers can use the special host.containers.internal address to access the host
oc port-forward --address 0.0.0.0 svc/kessel-inventory-api 8000:8000 &
oc port-forward --address 0.0.0.0 svc/kessel-inventory-consumer-service 9000:9000 &
oc port-forward --address 0.0.0.0 kessel-kafka-connect-connect-0 9404:9404 &
```

3. Access Prometheus in your browser at `localhost:9050`

Metrics will then be scraped from the running pods in ephemeral through your port-forwarding connection!
